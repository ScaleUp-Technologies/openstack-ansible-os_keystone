features:
  - Introduced option to deploy Keystone under Uwsgi. A new variable
    ``keystone_mod_wsgi_enabled`` is introduced to toggle this
    behavior. The ports used by Uwsgi for socket and http connection
    for both public and admin Keystone services are configurable
    (see also the ``keystone_uwsgi_ports`` dictionary variable).
    Federation features should be considered _experimental_ with
    this configuration at this time. The default is ``true`` which
    continues to deploy with mod_wsgi for Apache.
  - Introduced option to deploy Keystone behind Nginx. A new
    variable ``keystone_apache_enabled`` is introduced to toggle
    this behavior. Additional configuration can be delivered to
    Nginx through the use of the ``keystone_nginx_extra_conf`` list
    variable. Federation features are not supported with this
    configuration at this time. Use of this option requires
    ``keystone_mod_wsgi_enabled`` to be set to ``false`` which will
    deploy Keystone under Uwsgi. The default is ``true`` which
    continues to deploy with Apache.
